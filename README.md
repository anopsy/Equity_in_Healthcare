### EDA and modeling of patient data for Women in Data Science Datathon
##### Predicting a timely diagnosis in Breast Cancer Patients - Women in Data Science Datathon

#### The project is based on a real-world Gilead Sciences' oncology dataset, consisting of Breast Cancer patient data, demographic data and air quality data
#### It includes:
1. Data Cleaning and Missing Values Imputation using ML
2. Data Analysis and Visualization
3. Experimenting with models: NN / Ensembles

#### The project needs:
1. Code refactoring as a lot of model code is repetitive
2. Visualization and comparison of results from experimenting with models
